judge: |-
    You are the supervisor of an AI agent who writes code and the agent is trying to solve a task. 
    
    Task: 
    {{task}}
    
    Code: 
    {{code}}
    
    Observations: 
    {{observations}}

    {%- if mcp_servers and mcp_servers.values()|length > 0 %}
    These functions are used to complete a step efficiently.
    {%- for server in mcp_servers.values() %}
    - {{ server.name }}: {{ server.description }}
        Takes inputs: {{server.inputs}}
        Returns an output of type: {{server.output_type}}
    {%- endfor %}
    {%- endif %}

    You must evaluate the agent's code and provide feedback on the following aspects:
    1. Correctness: Is the code correct and does it solve the task?
    2. Efficiency: Is the code efficient and does it follow best practices?

    You must make a decision by starting with a hashtag:
    1. #approve: If the code is correct, efficient and completes the task. Please specify why the code output does not miss any edge cases and it doesn't have issues in the output.
    2. #fail: If the code is incorrect, inefficient, does not solve the task, or has issues in the output. Please specify why the code cannot be improved to solve the task.
    3. #rethink: If the task can be rephrased for better outcome. Please provide guidance on how to rethink the task.

criteria: |-
    Here is the ranking task:
    ```
    {{ task }}
    ```

    This is only a random sample set of 10 companies from the set of all the companies to be ranked:
    
    {{ input_list_as_markdown }}
    
    A criteria is a plain text statement that states the set of variables that flow causality to the outcome of the ranking task.
    
    The criteria should only consider macro factors flow causality to the task and it should completely avoid criterias affected by time.

    Please provide a criteria for the ranking task.
variable: |-

    Here is the ranking task:
    ```
    {{ task }}
    ```

    Here is the criteria for the ranking task:
    ```
    {{ criteria }}
    ```

    List variables that flow causality to the criteria for the ranking task.

    A variable must be quantifiable and measurable with a numerical value.
graph: |-    

    TODO process each and every report and each and every fact to extrapolate a causal graph from the nodes
    via more nodes to the terminal node of the criteria.
    The name and description of the criteria will be used as the terminal node of the causal graph.

    The causal graph will be materialized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the following properties:
    1. The graph is directed, meaning that the edges have a direction, indicating the flow of information or influence from one node to another.
    2. The graph is acyclic, meaning that there are no loops or cycles in the graph.
    3. The graph is a DAG, meaning that it is a directed acyclic graph, which is a type of graph that has directed edges and no cycles.
    4. The graph is a causal graph, meaning that it represents the causal relationships between the nodes in the graph.
    5. The graph is a tree, meaning that it has a single root node and all other nodes are its descendants.
assignment: |-
    Assign value to each node in the graph for the criteria  causal graph for every entity to be ranked.
