      Here is the task:
      ```
      {{ task }}
      ```

      You have to complete the task by writing a plain text report. Do not include any markdown or any other formatting.
      
      The report must have a structure that is easy to read and understand.
      
      You must use variables to present information that requires grounding in external data sources or it is not known at the time of writing the report.
      Do not use variables to present information that is known at the time of writing the report.
      The variables must be compatible with Python String Template which supports $-based variable substitution.
      The variables will be used to fill in the report with data from external data sources.
      Do not include any text which is not to be read by the user.

      Write the plain text report with variables compatible with Python string template.

    action: final_answer

      Here is the task:

      {{task}}

      You came up with the following report to complete the task:
      ```
      {{ text_report }}
      ```
       
      {%- if state and state.items()|length > 0 %}
      The known variables in the report are:
      {%- for key, value in state.items() %}
      - {{ key  }}: {{ value }}

      {%- endfor %}
      {%- endif %}

      You have to formulate a question such that the answer to the question is the variable  {{ variable_name }} in the text report.

      Take into consideration the known variables and only ask a question that only answers the unknown information to fill in 
      the variable {{ variable_name }} in the text report.

      Please include relevant context for the {{ variable_name }} from the report in the question so that the question is clear and unambiguous.

      You came up with the following report to complete the task:
      ```
      {{ text_report }}
      ```

      You came up with the following question to find reference information to fill in the variable {{ variable_name }} in the text report:
      ```
      {{ variable_question }}
      ```
      
      The reference information you found is:
      ```
      {{ supporting_information }}
      ```
      
      Write only the answer to the question in plain text. Do not include any additional text, markdown or any other formatting.
