      Here is the task:

      {{ task }}

      {%- if hint and hint|length > 0 %}
      
      {{ hint }}

      {%- if variable_statement and variable_statement|length > 0 %}
      These are known statements that must be used to complete the task:
      {{ variable_statement }}
      {% endif %}
      

      You have to complete the task by writing a plain text report. Do not include any markdown or any other formatting. Do not include any instructions or any other text that is not to be read by the user.
      
      The report must have a structure that is easy to read and understand.
      
      You must use variables to present information that requires grounding in external data sources or it is not known at the time of writing the report.
      
      Do not use variables to present information that is known at the time of writing the report.
      
      The variables will be used to fill in the report with data from external data sources.
      
      Do not include any text which is not to be read by the user.
      
      The variables must be compatible with Python String Template substition, which means that each and every variable name must be presented in the format of $variable_name.
      
      Write the plain text report with variables.

      Here is the task:
      ```
      {{task}}
      ```
      
      You came up with the following final answer to complete the task:
      ```
      {{ final_answer }}
      ```
       
      {%- if known_variables and known_variables.items()|length > 0 %}
      The known variables in the final answer are:
      {%- for key, value in known_variables.items() %}
      - {{ key }}: {{ value }}

      {%- endfor %}
      {%- endif %}

      {%- if hint and hint|length > 0 %}
      
      {{ hint }}
      {% endif %}

      You have to formulate a question such that the answer to the question is the variable  {{ variable_name }} in the final answer.

      The question should only fetch additional information which is unknown to reduce ambiguity in the value of variable {{ variable_name }} in the final_answer.

      You came up with the following final answer to complete the task:
      ```
      {{ final_answer }}
      ```

      You came up with the following question to find reference information to fill in the variable {{ variable_name }} in the final answer:
      ```
      {{ variable_question }}
      ```
      
      {%- if hint and hint|length > 0 %}
      
      {{ hint }}
      {% endif %}

      The new reference information you found specifically to fill in the variable {{ variable_name }} in the final answer is:
      ```
      {{ supporting_information }}
      ```

      Write only the value for the variable {{ variable_name }} in to fill in the final answer. Do not include any other text or formatting.
